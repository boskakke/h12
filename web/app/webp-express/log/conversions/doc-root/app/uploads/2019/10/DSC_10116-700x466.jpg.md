Stack converter ignited

Options:
------------
The following options have been set explicitly. Note: it is the resulting options after merging down the "jpeg" and "png" options and any converter-prefixed options.

- log-call-arguments: true
- converters: (array of 9 items)

The following options have not been explicitly set, so using the following defaults:
- converter-options: (empty array)
- shuffle: false
- preferred-converters: (empty array)
- extra-converters: (empty array)

The following options were supplied and are passed on to the converters in the stack:
- encoding: "auto"
- metadata: "none"
- near-lossless: 60
- quality: 70

Encoding is set to auto - converting to both lossless and lossy and selecting the smallest file

Converting to lossy
Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version. Result: *Exec failed* (the cwebp binary was not found at path: cwebp)
Nope a plain cwebp call does not work
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 1 binaries: 
- /usr/local/bin/cwebp
Discovering binaries which are distributed with the webp-convert library (to skip this step, disable the "try-supplied-binary-for-os" option)
Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (Darwin)... We do.

Trying the first of these. If that should fail (it should not), the next will be tried and so on.
Creating command line options for version: 1.0.3
Quality: 70. 
Consider setting quality to "auto" instead. It is generally a better idea
The near-lossless option ignored for lossy
